Here is a log of all changes to the Oblivion masterlist relating to removing non-ASCII characters in preparation for UTF-8 conversion, and to ensure proper segragation of basic English and full international support.

Removed "Blakeley’s Lachrymal Bow.esp" as "Blakeley's Lachrymal Bow.esp" also exists.

Removed "Charon’s Call by Nicoroshi.esp" as "Charon's Call by Nicoroshi.esp" also exists.

Removed "Nico’s Quinga Bows.esp" as "Nico's Quinga Bows.esp" also exists.

Removed "UFF_Jenées_Honor.esp". No ASCII replacement. Will re-add after UTF-8 conversion. It was positioned directly below "UFF_Unrepetant_Archer.esp".

Removed "Albae+Gefährten.esp". No ASCII replacement. Will re-add after UTF-8 conversion. It was positioned directly below "Alexis_Magiergilde.esp".

Replaced "? Override merge animations – does not seem to work properly for VH Bloodlines." with "? Override merge animations - does not seem to work properly for VH Bloodlines."

Removed "Cure Disease Overhaul – Extreme Diseases.esp" as "Cure Disease Overhaul - Extreme Diseases.esp" also exists.

Removed "Can´t touch me!.esp" and "Canït touch me!.esp" as "Can't touch me!.esp" also exists. However, "Can´t touch me!.esp" is the correct name, so re-add after UTF-8 conversion.
