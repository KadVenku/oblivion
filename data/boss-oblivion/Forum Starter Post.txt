[/list][/b]

Better Oblivion Sorting Software (BOSS) will reorder your mods to their correct positions (as listed in the masterlist.txt database file), putting any mods it doesn't recognise after them, in the same order as they were before BOSS was run.

BOSS is designed to assist in the installation and usage of mods, especially more complex mods such as FCOM and MMM, and help mod users avoid serious conflicts. It is not a complete solution to load ordering issues, as there are far more mods out there (estimated at about 30,000) than BOSS knows about. To properly place mods BOSS doesn't know about, a good working knowledge of Oblivion mod load ordering is still necessary, for which some research and documentation reading will go a long way.

[u]REQUIREMENTS:[/u]

Windows (or Wine), Oblivion (or Fallout 3, Fallout: New Vegas or Nehrim), some mods.


[u]DOWNLOADS:[/u]

[url=http://www.tesnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=20516]Better Oblivion Sorting Software on TES Nexus[/url]

There are no official mirrors at this time.


[u]INSTALLATION AND USE:[/u]

1. If you have Wrye Bash, make sure the "Lock Times" function is deactivated.

2. If upgrading from an earlier version of BOSS, delete your BOSS.bat, modlist.txt, modlist.old, masterlist.txt and BOSSlog.txt files in your Data folder. If you have an edited masterlist, make sure to keep a backup so that your edits are not lost (and preferably copy your edits out in to the new userlist format).

3. Unzip the BOSS.zip to your ..\Oblivion\Data folder, so that BOSS.exe is in the same folder as your mods.

4. Run the "BOSS - Update Masterlist.bat" file to get the latest masterlist from the Internet and sort your mods.

5. When running BOSS normally, do so from the BOSS.exe, but remember to run the "BOSS - Update Masterlist.bat" regularly to ensure you have a recent masterlist.

Once BOSS has finished running, the output will be displayed automatically. Read any notes, FCOM installation errors if applicable, and make any relevant changes that are suggested by them. Wrye Bash will automatically import and apply Bash Tag suggestions from BOSS. Some Bash Tag suggestions can come with conditions and notes that require human intervention though, so read the suggestions makes thoroughly and adjust tags by hand in Wrye Bash if necessary.

You will need to reorder "unknown" mods by hand using OBMM or Wrye Bash.

You can update your masterlist to the latest version by running the "BOSS - Update Masterlist.bat" file. This will replace your copy with the latest available online, and then run BOSS as normal using the updated masterlist. If you have an edited masterlist, using this updater will cause you to lose all your edits.


[u]UNINSTALLATION:[/u]

Delete BOSS.exe, "BOSS - Update Masterlist.bat", "BOSS - Undo Last Run.bat" and, if BOSS has been run, the BOSS folder in your ..\Oblivion\Data folder.


[u]TROUBLESHOOTING:[/u]
[spoiler]
[b]Won't run: Using BOSS version under 1.6:[/b]
Update to version 1.6

[b]Won't run: BOSS not extracted (unzipped) to ...\oblivion\data but a sub-folder or the Oblivion folder.[/b]

All BOSS exe/bat files must share the same folder as your mods.

Check you have:
[list]
[*]BOSS.exe
[*]BOSS - Undo Last Run.bat (optional)
[*]BOSS - Update Masterlist.bat (optional)
[/list]in your ...\Oblivion\data folder.
and
[list]
[*]masterlist.txt (will be created if it doesn't exist if you run update (via batch file, cmd prompt or Wrye Bash)
[*]userlist.txt (optional)
[*]BOSS ReadMe.html (optional)
[*]BOSS User Rules ReadMe.html (optional)
[/list in your ...\Oblivion\data\BOSS
[/list]

[b]Won't change load order: OS is Vista and Oblivion is installed in Program Files.[/b]

Install Oblivion outside the Program Files folder where possible. Otherwise temporarily deactivate UAC.

[b]Won't Change load order and generating a blank text file: OS is Windows 7:[/b]

Give group or users name: BATCH controls of the Oblivion folder


[b]Won't change load order: Wrye Bash's load order locking feature is enabled.[/b]

Disable before changing load order.

[b]A text box flashes up but disappears.[/b]

Run BOSS.bat not BOSS.exe[/spoiler]

[u]FURTHER DETAILS:[/u]

[b]Command Line Arguments[/b]

BOSS has a few command-line arguments. The syntax is:

BOSS [--update | -u] [--help | -h] [--disable-version-parse | -V-] [--revert-level | -r] [level] [--silent-mode | -s]

-h, --help:

This prints a short description of BOSS and some information on the function of the command line arguments.

-u, --update:

If this switch is used, BOSS will automatically update the local copy of the masterlist using the latest version on the Google Code repository, and then sort your mods. Since this replaces your current masterlist, don't run this if you have an edited copy and wish to keep the changes. The "BOSS - Update Masterlist.bat" runs BOSS with this switch.

-V-, --disable-version-parse:

Disables the parsing of each mod's description to extract the author's version information, so it is not printed alongside other data in the generated BOSSlog.html. This can be used if the version parsing is not working properly for some of your mods, and you wish to remove the version notes.

-r level, --revert-level level:

Sets BOSS to undo its changes by reverting back the number of levels given by level to the load order at that point. level can take values of 1 or 2. A value of 1 will restore the load order to that stored in modlist.txt. A value of 2 will restore the load order to that stored in modlist.old. If the modlist that you are reverting to does not exist, BOSS will cancel the undo and display an error message. The modlist files are not updated when BOSS is run with this parameter.

-s, --silent-mode:

if this switch is used BOSS doesn't automatically launch the log when it finishes.


[b]BOSS Changes and Files[/b]

The only changes BOSS makes to your Oblivion install are to re-date the .esp and .esm files in your Data folder, to create a BOSS folder there, and create a few text files in that BOSS folder. Oblivion.esm is never touched, and all dates are derived from it.

The text files that are used and created by BOSS are all found in the ..\Oblivion\Data\BOSS folder, and they are:
[list]
[*]masterlist.txt - This is the master list of mods that BOSS recognises, listing them in order and which includes notes attached to them. It is the most frequently updated component of BOSS, receiving updates almost every day.
[*]BOSSlog.html - This log is where the output that BOSS generates and displays once the program ends is stored. It is replaced every time you run BOSS. You can view it in any web browser.
[*]modlist.txt - This file contains the list of your mods in the order they were before you last ran BOSS, which can be used to undo changes to your load order.
[*]modlist.old - This file contains the contents of your modlist.txt before you last ran BOSS, providing a second level of undo for load order changes.
[*]userlist.txt - This file contains your custom rules to be implemented by the User Rules feature.
[/list]

[b]Undoing Changes[/b]
To undo the changes BOSS makes to your load order, you can use the included "BOSS - Undo Last Run.bat" file. The .bat file will, by default, revert to the load order before the last run of BOSS, as stored in modlist.txt. If you want to revert back to the load order before that, as stored in modlist.old, you will need to edit your "BOSS - Undo Last Run.bat" file:

1. Right-click it and select "Edit" to open it up in Notepad.

2. On the line containing "BOSS.exe -r 1", replace the 1 with a 2 to give "BOSS.exe -r 2".

3. Then save the file and run it to revert your load order back two levels.


[b]Customising How BOSS Works[/b]
The best way that users can customise how BOSS works is by using the included User Rules feature. This feature allows you to define the positions of mods not in the masterlist, and to override the masterlist positions of mods, as well as edit the output messages of mods, and more. In addition, this is all done without editing the masterlist.txt, so when you update it using the built-in updater, your changes shall not be lost. All the information on the User Rules feature can be found in the "BOSS User Rules ReadMe.html" file.

An alternative is to use the [url=http://www.tesnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=29790]BOSS Master List Manager[/url] (BOMM) by Surazal, which is a Word 2003, 2007 and 2010 Macro that provides similar features.

[u]CONTRIBUTIONS AND HELP:[/u]

Questions, suggestions, unrecognized mods and general discussion takes place [url=http://www.bethsoft.com/bgsforums/index.php?showtopic=1117093]HERE[/url].

User corrections to the masterlist are vital. Let us know what you know.

Lists of unrecognized mods are welcome but the only way we can include them in the database in a timely way is if we get: 
[list=1]
[*]The ESP/ESM file name(s) and 
[*] A link to where the description, download or readme can be found to read or download. 
[*] A brief description of each mod will also help. Feel free to make load order suggestions.
[/list]


[u]UPDATES:[/u]

Updates are published at the TES Nexus BOSS page.

For those not using the masterlist updater, the latest masterlist is always on the Google Code repository.

Always make sure to use the latest release of the BOSS program, and the latest masterlist.
